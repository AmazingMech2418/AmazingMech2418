# Welcome!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm **AmazingMech2418**.

"AmazingMech2418" has, over the past few years, become a pseudonym for myself. I use AmazingMech2418 as my username on many different websites.

If you come across a username of "AM2418" instead, that might still be me (especially if AmazingMech2418 doesn't fit in the username length limit).

## My Skills

I am a...
- Ethical hacker/penetration tester
- Programmer
- Web developer
- Game developer
- Software developer
- Fullstack JS developer
- And **more**!


I also program in many programming languages, mainly JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, C/C++, Java, and Bash, but also know the basics of other languages such as
- APL (please, no... I don't have an APL keyboard...)
- BASIC/QBasic/TI-BASIC
- Crystal/Ruby
- C#
- D
- Dart
- Elixir/Erlang (these are very annoying...)
- Forth
- Fortran
- F#
- Go
- Haskell
- Julia
- Kotlin
- Lisp (mainly Scheme, Clojure, and Emacs Lisp)
- LOLCODE (yes, an esolang)
- Lua
- Nim
- PHP
- R
- Raku/Perl 6
- Reason (not my favorite, but not *too* bad...)
- Rust
- Scala
- Swift
- Tcl (also, not my favorite...)

Of course, among these langauges even, I have my preferences, but I can program in any of them if needed (given documentation for anything I don't know in them, such as string methods)
